// listStoreReadBudget is the longest GET /agents and GET /sessions wait for a

// store. On the town that store is Dolt, and whenever the pool is full a full

// instead of agents (vn-fzant5y). It is a var so tests can shorten it.

//  1. the full list, when it lands inside the budget;
//  2. the last full list, marked partial with its age, when one is saved and

//  3. storeFree's list, marked partial as still loading.

// still gets its 400. A build that fails later is only logged: its caller has
